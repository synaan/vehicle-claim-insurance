# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning classification techniques.
It analyzes historical transaction data to identify patterns associated with fraud and builds a
predictive model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Problem Statement
Fraudulent transactions lead to major financial losses. Manual detection is inefficient and error-prone.
This project develops an automated machine learning solution to accurately identify fraud.

## Objectives
- Understand and analyze transaction data
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and train classification models
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict fraudulent transactions effectively
